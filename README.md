# Vue Cocktails
An awesome site where you can choose from a list:
- favorite ingredient and get a list of cocktails that contain your favorite ingredient;
- enter the name of the ingredient yourself and also get a list of cocktails.

Moreover, when you get a list of cocktails, you can click on the cocktail you are interested in and you will be taken to a page with a recipe for its preparation.
Or...click on "get random cocktail" where you can read the description of the cocktail and view its ingredients with the slider.
